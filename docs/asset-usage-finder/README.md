## 🎯 What Problems Does Asset Usage Finder Solve?

### Problem #1: "Where Is This Asset Used?"

**Without Asset Usage Finder:**

```
1. You want to delete or modify a texture
2. You don't know what prefabs, materials, or scenes use it
3. You search manually through:
   - 50+ prefabs
   - 20+ scenes
   - Dozens of materials and ScriptableObjects
4. You miss one reference
5. Your build breaks
6. ⏱️ Time wasted: 20-60 minutes
```

**With Asset Usage Finder:**

```
1. Right-click the texture → Find References in Project
2. See complete list of usages in < 5 seconds
3. Click any result to jump to it
4. Delete or modify with confidence
5. ⏱️ Time wasted: < 1 minute
```

### Problem #2: "Can I Safely Delete This?"

**Scenario:** Your project has 5000+ assets. Which ones can be safely deleted?

**Without Asset Usage Finder:**

```
❌ Guess and hope for the best
❌ Delete and hope nothing breaks
❌ Test every scene manually (impossible for large projects)
❌ Leave unused assets forever (bloated project size)
```

**With Asset Usage Finder:**

```
✅ Right-click → Find References in Project
✅ If "No references found" → Safe to delete
✅ If references exist → Review list before deciding
✅ Clean projects, smaller builds, faster iteration
```

### Problem #3: "This Prefab Changed—What's Affected?"

**Scenario:** You modified a commonly-used UI prefab. What scenes need testing?

**Without Asset Usage Finder:**

```
❌ Open every scene and search manually
❌ Use Unity's Find References (only works for scene objects)
❌ Ask teammates "does anyone use this?"
❌ Miss a reference and ship a bug
```

**With Asset Usage Finder:**

```
✅ Right-click prefab → Find References in Project
✅ See exact list of scenes using it
✅ Test those specific scenes
✅ Ship with confidence
```

## 💡 Why Asset Usage Finder Exists

Unity's built-in reference finding is limited:

| Capability                       | Unity Built-in | Asset Usage Finder |
| -------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Find references in Project view  | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes             |
| Find references across scenes    | ⚠️ Limited     | ✅ Complete        |
| Find references in prefabs       | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes             |
| Find nested prefab references    | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes             |
| Find ScriptableObject references | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes             |
| Search speed                     | N/A            | ✅ Fast (< 5s)     |
| Export results                   | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes (some vers) |

**Unity's built-in tools can only:**

- Show dependencies (what an asset depends on)
- Find references for scene objects (only works within the current scene)

**Asset Usage Finder can:**

- Show usages (what depends on an asset)
- Search across ALL scenes, prefabs, materials, ScriptableObjects, etc.
- Handle nested prefabs and prefab variants
- Work with ANY asset type

---

## 🔥 How to Use It

### Basic Usage: Find References

```
Step 1: Select any asset in the Project window
   Examples:
   - Sprite/Texture
   - Prefab
   - Material
   - Audio clip
   - ScriptableObject
   - Script file
   - Any other asset

Step 2: Right-click → Find References in Project
   (Keyboard shortcut: typically Alt+Shift+F or similar)

Step 3: Results appear in the Asset Usage Finder window showing:
   - Scene references
   - Prefab references
   - Material references
   - ScriptableObject references
   - Other asset references
   - Nested references (e.g., prefabs using other prefabs)

Step 4: Click any result to:
   - Jump to the asset in Project view
   - Open the scene/prefab
   - Inspect the exact usage
```

### Advanced Usage: Batch Analysis

Some versions support selecting **multiple assets** to find references for all at once:

```
1. Select multiple assets (Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click)
2. Right-click → Find References in Project
3. See aggregated results for all selected assets
4. Identify shared dependencies
```

### Use Case: Cleaning Unused Assets

```
Goal: Remove unused textures to reduce build size

Step 1: Select the "Textures" folder
Step 2: Run Find References on each texture (or batch if supported)
Step 3: For each texture with "No references found":
   - Mark for deletion
   - Double-check it's not used in custom scripts
Step 4: Delete unused textures
Step 5: Build size reduced!

Real-world result: Projects often have 10-30% unused assets
```

### Use Case: Refactoring Safely

```
Goal: Replace an old UI button prefab with a new one

Step 1: Find References for old button prefab
Step 2: See all scenes/prefabs using it (example: 15 locations)
Step 3: Open each location
Step 4: Replace old prefab with new one
Step 5: Verify nothing is broken
Step 6: Delete old prefab with confidence

Without this tool: You'd miss 2-3 references and break your UI
```

### Use Case: Build Size Optimization

```
Goal: Identify which assets contribute most to build size

Step 1: Look at build report (see [Better Build Info PRO](../better-build-info/README.md) docs)
Step 2: Identify large assets (e.g., 10MB texture)
Step 3: Use Asset Usage Finder to see where it's used
Step 4: Decide:
   - Is it worth the size? (used in key features)
   - Can we optimize it? (reduce resolution)
   - Can we replace it? (find lighter alternative)

This workflow helps cut build sizes by 20-50% in bloated projects
```

## ⚠️ Pitfalls & Limitations

### Pitfall #1: "No References Found" ≠ Definitely Safe to Delete

**Problem:** Asset Usage Finder searches serialized references, but code can load assets at runtime.

```csharp
// ❌ This won't be detected by Asset Usage Finder
Resources.Load<Sprite>("UI/MySprite");

// ❌ This won't be detected either
AssetDatabase.LoadAssetAtPath<GameObject>("Assets/Prefabs/Enemy.prefab");

// ✅ This WILL be detected
[SerializeField] private Sprite mySprite;
```

**Solution:** Before deleting assets with no references:

1. Search your codebase for string references to the asset name
2. Check Resources folders (commonly loaded by name)
3. Check AssetBundles (may load by path)
4. Test your build to ensure nothing breaks

### Pitfall #2: Searching Large Projects Can Be Slow

**Problem:** Searching 10,000+ assets takes time (though still faster than manual searching).

**Solution:**

- Close unnecessary Unity Editor windows to reduce overhead
- Search specific folders instead of entire project when possible
- Consider using Asset Usage Finder's caching features (if available in your version)
- Upgrade to a paid version if search speed is critical

### Pitfall #3: Results Can Be Overwhelming

**Problem:** Popular assets (e.g., a standard UI sprite) might have 200+ references.

**Solution:**

- Use the search/filter box in the results window
- Sort results by type (scenes, prefabs, materials)
- Export results to a text file for external processing
- Focus on specific usage patterns (e.g., "only show scene references")

### Pitfall #4: Prefab Variants Complicate Analysis

**Problem:** A prefab variant might use an asset, but the result shows the base prefab.

```
Base Prefab: Button.prefab (uses ButtonSprite.png)
Variant: Button_Red.prefab (overrides sprite to ButtonSprite_Red.png)

Asset Usage Finder might show:
- ButtonSprite.png → Button.prefab ✅
- ButtonSprite_Red.png → Button.prefab ⚠️ (actually used by variant)
```

**Solution:**

- Understand your prefab hierarchy
- Check both base prefabs and variants
- Use Unity's Prefab Overrides inspector to verify

### Pitfall #5: Dynamic References Not Detected

**Problem:** Addressables, AssetBundles, and other dynamic loading systems are hard to track.

```csharp
// ❌ Addressables references might not be detected
Addressables.LoadAssetAsync<GameObject>("Enemy");
```

**Solution:**

- Manually review Addressables catalogs
- Use Addressables' built-in reference analyzer
- Keep a separate document of dynamic references
- Test builds thoroughly

```
Problem: Android APK is 200MB, needs to be under 150MB

Solution:
1. Use [Better Build Info PRO](../better-build-info/README.md) to identify largest assets
2. Use Asset Usage Finder on each large asset
3. Findings:
   - 30MB texture used only in tutorial (can compress)
   - 15MB audio clip unreferenced (safe to delete)
   - 10MB prefab only used in debug scenes (exclude from build)
4. Result: Build reduced to 135MB

Time saved: Found in 30 minutes vs. 4+ hours of manual searching
```

### Use Case 2: Refactoring a UI System

```
Problem: Replacing old UI framework with new one

Solution:
1. List all old UI prefabs
2. Find References for each one
3. Results show 47 locations across 12 scenes
4. Create checklist of scenes to update
5. Replace references systematically
6. Verify no old prefabs remain
7. Delete old UI framework

Without this tool: Would miss references, break UI, angry players
```

### Use Case 3: Onboarding New Team Members

```
Problem: New developer asks "where is this enemy prefab used?"

Solution:
1. Show them Asset Usage Finder
2. Right-click enemy prefab → Find References
3. They see it's used in:
   - Level1.scene
   - Level3.scene
   - TestArena.scene
   - EnemyManager.prefab
4. They understand project structure in 30 seconds

Alternative: They'd spend 2 hours exploring scenes manually
```

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Deleting Assets with Runtime References

```csharp
// This asset won't show up in Asset Usage Finder
Resources.Load<Sprite>("UI/Icons/Health");
```

**Solution:** Search your code for the asset name before deleting.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Addressables

```csharp
// Addressables references might not be detected
Addressables.LoadAssetAsync<GameObject>("Enemies/Boss");
```

**Solution:** Use Addressables' built-in analyzers alongside Asset Usage Finder.

### Mistake #3: Not Testing After Cleanup

**Problem:** Deleted 50 "unused" assets, build compiles, but game crashes at runtime.

**Solution:** Always test your build after cleanup. Consider using version control to revert if
needed.

---

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Does it slow down Unity?** A: No. It only runs when you explicitly request it. No background
overhead.

**Q: Can it find references in code?** A: No. It finds serialized references (Inspector
assignments). Use your IDE's "Find Usages" for code references.

**Q: Does it work with Unity 2023+?** A: Yes, both
[Asset Usage Finder](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/asset-usage-finder-59997)
and
[Asset Usage Detector](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/asset-usage-detector-112837)
support modern Unity versions.

**Q: What about Addressables?** A: Some versions support Addressables. Check your version's
documentation. Otherwise, use Addressables' built-in analyzers.

**Q: Can I use it in runtime builds?** A: No. It's an editor-only tool. It doesn't affect builds at
all.

**Q: Does it work with nested prefabs?** A: Yes (in Unity 2018.3+). It handles nested prefabs and
prefab variants.

**Q: Is the free version good enough?** A: For small-to-medium projects, yes. Large studios often
upgrade for better performance and features.
