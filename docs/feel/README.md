# Feel Documentation

## What is Feel?

Feel (by More Mountains) is a **comprehensive game feel library** for Unity that provides **150+
ready-to-use feedback effects**. It transforms flat, unresponsive games into juicy, satisfying
experiences with **minimal code** and **maximum designer control**.

Instead of writing hundreds of lines of code for screen shakes, particle effects, camera zooms,
audio triggers, and UI animations, you assemble pre-built feedbacks in the Inspector and call a
single method: `PlayFeedbacks()`.

**Feel makes game feel accessible to everyone** ‚Äî no programming expertise required.

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----- |
| **Commercial game**            | **Feel**                        | ~$50  |
| **Code-first animations only** | **PrimeTween**                  | FREE  |
| **Maximum performance**        | **LitMotion** or **PrimeTween** | FREE  |
| **Complete game feel system**  | **Feel**                        | ~$50  |

## Quick Start

```csharp
// 1. Add MMFeedbacks component to any GameObject
// 2. In Inspector: "Add new feedback" ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Camera Shake
// 3. Configure duration (0.3s), amplitude (0.5), frequency (25)
// 4. Call from your script:

public MMFeedbacks screenShakeFeedback;

void OnHit()
{
    screenShakeFeedback.PlayFeedbacks(); // That's it!
}
```

**Result**: Professional-quality screen shake with damping, multiple axes, and smooth curves ‚Äî no
complex code needed.

2. Skim [Feedback Catalog](03-FEEDBACK-CATALOG.md) (don't memorize, just browse)
3. Add 5-10 feedbacks to your game (jump, hit, UI clicks, etc.)
4. Experiment with combining multiple feedbacks

**Goal**: Become comfortable adding feedback to your game.

### Phase 3: Mastery (ongoing)

1. Read [Advanced Techniques](04-ADVANCED-TECHNIQUES.md)
2. Try scripting with MMFeedbacks (dynamic intensity, events)
3. Create a custom feedback for your game's unique needs
4. Optimize feedback performance

**Goal**: Unlock Feel's full power for production games.

### Phase 4: Troubleshooting (as needed)

## Philosophy

Feel is built on the principle that **game feel should be accessible to everyone**. You shouldn't
need to be a graphics programmer to make your game feel great.

### Core Beliefs

**1. Iteration Speed > Control** Fast iteration beats perfect control. Feel prioritizes rapid
prototyping so you can try 100 ideas and keep the 10 that work.

**2. Designer Empowerment** Designers understand game feel better than programmers. Feel puts
feedback control directly in their hands.

**3. "Good Enough" is Great** Feel's 150+ feedbacks cover 95% of use cases. For the remaining 5%,
you can extend Feel with custom feedbacks.

**4. Composition Over Complexity** Stack simple feedbacks to create complex effects. No monolithic
systems, just LEGO blocks.

## Real-World Impact

### Before Feel

```
Workflow:
  Designer: "Can we make the screen shake harder?"
  Programmer: "Sure, let me adjust the code..."
  (30 minutes later)
  Programmer: "How's this?"
  Designer: "Better, but can we add a red flash?"
  Programmer: *sighs*

Iteration cycle: Hours to days
Game feel: Mediocre (limited by programmer time)
```

### After Feel

```
Workflow:
  Designer: *Opens Inspector*
  Designer: *Adjusts Camera Shake intensity slider*
  Designer: *Adds Camera Flash feedback with red color*
  Designer: *Hits Play*
  Designer: "Perfect! Shipped."

Iteration cycle: Seconds to minutes
Game feel: Excellent (unlimited designer iteration)
```

**Real Quote from Indie Developer:**

> "Feel transformed my game from 'meh' to 'wow' in days. I'm a solo dev ‚Äî I don't have time to write
> custom feedback systems. Feel let me focus on level design while still having insanely juicy game
> feel."

## FAQ

**Q: Is Feel worth ‚Ç¨46?** A: If it saves you 2 days of work, yes. Most developers report 1-2 weeks
saved on feedback systems. See [Why Feel?](02-WHY-FEEL.md) for cost-benefit analysis.

**Q: Can I use the free MMFeedbacks version?** A: Yes! It includes ~80 core feedbacks. Upgrade to
Feel when you need post-processing, haptics, or advanced features.

**Q: Does Feel work with DOTween/LeanTween?** A: Yes! They serve different purposes. Use DOTween for
code-driven animations, Feel for game feel. Many projects use both.

**Q: Does Feel work with URP/HDRP?** A: Yes, fully supported. Post-processing feedbacks require
URP/HDRP with Volume components.

**Q: Can I extend Feel with custom feedbacks?** A: Absolutely! See
[Advanced Techniques](04-ADVANCED-TECHNIQUES.md) ‚Üí Creating Custom Feedbacks.

**Q: Does Feel impact performance?** A: Minimal impact. Zero allocations after warmup, object
pooling included. See [Advanced Techniques](04-ADVANCED-TECHNIQUES.md) ‚Üí Performance Optimization.

**Q: Does Feel work on mobile?** A: Yes! Includes mobile haptics for iOS (Taptic Engine) and
Android. Automatically handles platform differences.

**Q: Can I use Feel in commercial games?** A: Yes, no royalties or restrictions. Buy once, use in
unlimited projects.
