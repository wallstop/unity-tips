# Best Practices & Examples

> Optimise your workflow with repeatable patterns, team policies, and automation ideas.

---

## When to Hot Reload vs. Recompile

- Use Hot Reload for logic tweaks, UI text, and gameplay balancing.
- Recompile when adding scripts, changing public API surface, or touching attributes.
- Schedule periodic clean recompiles (e.g., daily) to ensure the project still builds fresh.

---

## Team Workflow Patterns

- Agree on when to click **Recompile** (typically before committing).
- Document the workflow in your team wiki and link to this guide.
- Pair with feature flags: toggle behaviours via hot reload to test quickly.

---

## Working with Unit Tests

- Hot reload supports Play Mode and Edit Mode testsâ€”rerun failed tests after patching.
- If a test references a newly added method, do a full recompile first.

---

## Excluding from Builds

- Keep editor-only scripts (e.g., dev tools) inside an `Editor` folder or wrap with
  `#if UNITY_EDITOR` so they stay out of player builds.
- For enterprise setups, consider a custom build check that verifies no hot reload patches are
  pending before releasing.

---

## State Management Tips

- Persist debug values in ScriptableObjects so they survive hot reload and domain reload.
- When working with static fields, expose reset buttons in the editor to clear state manually.

## Example Workflow

```csharp
public class EnemySpawner : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private float _spawnInterval = 5f;
    [SerializeField] private GameObject _enemyPrefab;

    private float _timer;

    void Update()
    {
        _timer += Time.deltaTime;
        if (_timer >= _spawnInterval)
        {
            _timer = 0f;
            Spawn();
        }
    }

    private void Spawn()
    {
        Instantiate(_enemyPrefab, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);
    }
}
```

Change `_spawnInterval` or the behaviour inside `Spawn()` during Play Mode to tune pacing instantly.

## Next Steps

1. Read [Getting Started](01-GETTING-STARTED.md) if you skipped the setup.
2. Share [How to Use It](03-HOW-TO-USE.md) with the rest of your team.
3. Log recurring issues in your project wiki so the whole team benefits.

Keep iterating quickly, and combine Hot Reload with profiling tools to spot performance regressions
as soon as they appear.
